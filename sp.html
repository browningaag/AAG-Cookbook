        <ul>
            <p><i>Scallion Mixture: </i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>10 tbsp scallion (about 9 scallions) </li>
                <li>14 tbsp shortening or lard</li>
                <li>2 ¼ tsp salt</li>

            <p><i>Dough Mixture:</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 cups (1kg) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 cups hot water (add more if needed for desired consistency)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <p class="in-title">Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gradually add the water into the flour until it forms a big ball of dough Knead dough very well until smooth with no lumps. If too dry, add drips of cold water at intervals until desired consistency is reached. Cover dough with damp cloth/plastic
                wrap and set aside for 15 min</li>
            <li>
                Mix scallion mix in a bowl and set aside</li>
            <li>
                Move dough onto a well-floured counter. Make a hole in the middle of the ball of dough (like a giant donut). Make a cut to the donut’s radius so you end up with a large cylinder of dough. Roll out to make a cylinder of 2-3 inches diameter</li>
            <li>
                Cut the cylinder into 12 sections</li>
            <li>
                Roll each section into a ball (keep flouring as you do the above steps)</li>
            <li>
                With a straight rolling pin (common in Chinese kitchens but easily available), roll each ball into a large thin circle, 1mm thick (as thin as you can but still thick enough to fold without tearing). Spinning the circle while rolling helps to maintain
                a round disk.</li>
            <li>
                Spread 1 Tbsp of scallion mixture evenly (and thinly) all over the circle. Make sure every inch is covered with the shortening.</li>
            <li>
                Starting at one edge of the circle, roll the circle into a 2-inch wide flat roll. Fold over at two- inch intervals. You end up with what looks like a flattened paper towel roll.</li>
            <li>
                Then place the flat piece of dough such that it points 12–6 o’clock, towards you. Then roll from 6 o’clock towards 12 o’clock so you end up with what looks like a snail’s shell. Don’t make this too loose.</li>
            <li>
                Decide how many you will cook, and wrap and freeze the rest.</li>
            <li>
                With the spiral coil facing up, roll out again into a big flattish circle (half an inch thick, or 8 inch across) so you end up with a pancake with a spiral texture. Again, spinning the circle while rolling helps maintain a round disk.</li>
            <li>
                Lightly pan-fry on both sides with cooking oil (experiment to see how much you need for your pan and stove, remembering there is a lot of oil in the pancake already). With our cooktop, we have found success (to avoid burning) frying each side 1 minute
                on medium low heat, then 45 seconds on medium high. The result should be a nicely browned and crispy pancake on the outside, and not too soggy.</li>
            <li>
                We are still tweaking this second method: to steam the pancake on the pan at the same time for a more moist interior. Our thinking is that it would work best to pan fry the first side as above, flip it, turn heat to medium low, then pour a half cup of
                water into the pan. Cover for 30 seconds. Uncover, and fry 30 more minutes on medium low, and then 45 minutes on medium high. By now the war should have completely evaporated.</li>
